## Research Areas

- Creative Generation — poetry, narrative, and expressive AI
- Sanskrit Computational Linguistics — cross-lingual semantics, summarization, linguistic tools
- Multi-Agent Systems — reasoning, debate, simulation, and decision-making frameworks

## Motivation & Vision

I aim to explore the full breadth and depth of AI, with a long-term focus on building multi-agent systems capable of robust reasoning, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving.

## Key Research Directions

- Multi-agent frameworks for stock analysis and investment decisions
- Multi-agent legal reasoning and courtroom-style argument simulation
- Cross-lingual summarization for Indic and global languages
- Creative systems for poetry and generative expression
- Cognitive memory evaluation frameworks for LLMs
- Multi-agent debate and self-improvement ecosystems
- Reinforcement Learning for improving Small Language Models

## Technical Strengths

- LLM finetuning, RLHF/RLAIF, and model compression (QAT)
- Multi-agent orchestration and agent pipeline design
- IR/RAG pipelines and evaluation frameworks
- Sanskrit NLP tooling (morphology, semantics, sandhi systems)
- Dataset creation, benchmarking, and distributed training
- Cloud compute workflows across GCP/AWS

## Research Funding

**Google GCP Gemma Academic Program Award (November 2025)**

## Collaboration Interests

I welcome collaborations in the following areas:
- Multi-agent systems
- Sanskrit computational linguistics
- Creative and multimodal generation
- Academic and industry research partnerships
- Open-source projects
- Dataset and benchmark creation
- Joint grant proposals
- Student mentorship and research guidance

If any of these align with your work, I’d be happy to connect.
