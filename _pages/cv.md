Education
======
* **PhD in Natural Language Processing** *Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur* **2026 (expected)**
* **M.Sc. Financial Engineering** *WorldQuant University, USA* **2022**
* **M.Tech. Data Science and Engineering** *Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani*, **2022**
* **B.E. Information Science and Engineering**, *University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, Bengaluru* **2018**

Work experience
======
* **06/2023 – Present**: **Staff Data Scientist**. *Juniper Networks*
  * Leading AI initiatives in the Mist Marvis platform, focusing on AP Health and Blackhole detection through intelligent root cause analysis (RCA).
  * Developed and led a 10-member team of Data Scientists and ML Engineers to build AI-driven network management tools, including log monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated RCA.
  * Designed and deployed a multi-model pipeline integrating Anomaly Detection, Seq2Seq models, Sentiment Analysis, Markov Chains, and Event Correlation for log summarization and RCA, with LLM-powered reporting and chatbot support.
  * Spearheaded Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining LLMs and Information Retrieval to enhance chatbot troubleshooting capabilities.
  * Fine-tuned domain-specific small language models (SLMs) and trained network-centric frontier LLMs to support agentic approaches in network troubleshooting.
  * Acted as SME for AI-based Log Monitoring, collaborating with stakeholders and customers to refine internal tools and external product features via regular demos and feedback loops.

* **09/2021 – 06/2023**: **Senior Data Scientist**. *Deloitte*
  * Worked on optimizing price, promotion, place, and product in the context of demand prediction. Using machine learning, developed models to predict demand and recommend optimal pricing strategies for different products. 
  * Build Next-gen Massive-scale Identity Resolution System using Graphs:  Identifying, connecting and assigning an ID for different data ranging from email campaign, click-stream (activity on the website), purchase order, etc. to get the data of customers from all the stages of the E-Commerce customer purchase funnel. The raw data collected by the platform's client are often inaccurate and incomplete. Identity resolution allows completion of missing data. 
  * Mentored Junior Developers through their on-boarding and day to day work.

* **04/2021 – 08/2021**: **Data Scientist**. *DataDirect Networks*
  * Predictive Maintenance using machine learning
  * Storage Device Performance Scoring by using parameters like IOPS, throughput and latency among others. The system also suggests optimum load capacity.

* **06/2018 – 04/2021**: **Data Scientist**. *Rakuten*
  * Conducted bottom-up customer-item interaction analysis to identify opportunities for launching new product lines, categories, and genres to drive revenue growth.
  * Delivered key marketing analytics use cases, including Customer Acquisition, Churn Prediction, Cross-sell, Retention, Reactivation, and ROI Optimization.
  * Optimized marketing campaign targeting strategies, leading to a 25\% increase in conversion rate and contributing to gross merchandise sales of $\approx$\$15M.
  * Designed and implemented a scalable ML lifecycle automation framework (inspired by Uber Michelangelo), enabling reproducible experimentation and deployment.
  * Built internal tools to analyze curator performance and created executive dashboards to surface key issues and improve operational efficiency.
  * Mentored junior engineers and interns, fostering skill development in data science and ML practices.

* **01/2018 – 06/2018**: **Intern**. *Rakuten*
  * Product catalog enrichment using attribute extraction from product title and details
  * Product matching with competitor products for data enrichment, competitor analysis and other purposes
  * Building intelligent crawlers

* **10/2016 - 09/2017**: **Intern**. *Jotarthur*
  * Text analytics engine to understand multiple aspects of customers like sentiment, intent, preference, etc.
  * Rapid Prototyping and Software Development
