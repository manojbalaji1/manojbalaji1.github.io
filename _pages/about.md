From my childhood, I have had a very high curiosity which has made me a constant learner. My passion for learning new things is unsatiable. This got me to complete my Bachelor's and finish a couple of internships during the course. This also fuelled me to publish research papers and get me enrolled in a Master's Degree to continue the learning path. I am very curious about mathematics and its application in different fields such as Physics, Finance, Data Science.

I am a problem-solver by nature. I will sit with you, understand the problem, ask you more questions to get my doubts cleared, and will actively brainstorm with you. We will go through the problem-solving cycle
Understand --> Formulate --> Hypothesize --> Brainstorm --> PoC --> Test --> Deploy --> Repeat
repeatedly and go through solving the problem in an iterative fashion(One can just not reach Mars in a single step :p ).

I am also an open-source contributor with my latest contributions have been in Google's datacommonsorg/api-python, uber/causalml apart from other past contributions.

From a research perspective, my interest lies in solving problems related to Causal Inference, Optimization, Computer Vision. I have been constantly working on many research projects. Please feel free to ping me if anyone wants to discuss more on these topics!
